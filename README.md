# WebScraper
I wrote this html parser in python to convert my gym's web-calendar into a csv file. This csv file can then be uploaded to google calendar or Microsoft Outlook calendar or what not. 

My purpose was to be able to check when certain studios were available.  I like to do tai chi in an available studio. The gym's calendar was not very intuitive to find available times.
